<h5 style="text-align: left;font-weight:700;font-size:14px;letter-spacing:1px;text-transform:uppercase;">Exercise 9</h5>
<p>In this exercise we will be diving into using <span style="font-weight:700;">media queries</span>, <span style="font-weight:700;">responsive units</span>, and <span style="font-weight:700;">responsive images</span>. You will all be using the same exercise-9 starting files which you will add your own content and styling to. Please follow the steps below to complete this exercise before class on Thursday, Nov. 13.</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Find an article on Wikipedia about something that you are passionate about that you will use for the written content in this exercise. Copy the first three paragraphs of the article and paste them into your index.html file in the downloaded exercise-9 folder.</li>
  <li>Based on your article please find either a Google font or Adobe font that you feel connects to your subject matter in some way. For example if my subject is the Detroit Tigers baseball team I might choose a script font like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Handwriting">Pacifico</a> or <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Molle?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Handwriting">Molle</a> that are reminiscent of script baseball wordmarks on the fronts of jerseys. This font will be used for your headers in this exercise. I'd like you to utilize one of the following Google fonts for the body copy: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif">Merriweather</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif">Playfair Display</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Sans+Serif">Open Sans</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Sans+Serif">Source Sans</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Sans+Serif">Montserrat</a>, or <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Baseball&preview.text_type=custom&category=Sans+Serif">Roboto</a>.</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> and find TWO images that connect to your subject in some way. Save these images to the assets folder in your exercise-9 folder. You need to also copy the attribution or credit that comes with each photo and include both as captions for the images on your site.</li>
  <li>Choose two to three colors that you think go well together and connect in some way to your topic. Add those colors to your site in some way.</li>
  <li>Style your mobile site first using the techniques shown in class today and then use your two media queries to style your tablet and desktop versions of your site.</li>
  <li>The footer on your tablet site must be two columns and the footer on your desktop site must be three columns like in the example.</li>
  <li>Use flexbox on your desktop site to create three distinct rows in your main section. Your first row should just be a paragraph, and your second and third should both have one paragraph and one image in both rows. Please see the example if you are confused.</li>
  <li>When you are done with your exercise please push it live to Github and include a link to the site on your Github.io home page.</li>
</ul>

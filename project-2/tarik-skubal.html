      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Inge played baseball at Brookville High School in Lynchburg, Virginia, also playing American Legion Baseball. He was named Legion Baseball's 2010 Graduate of the Year.[3] Brookville retired Inge's uniform number</p>

        <p class="orange">He then attended Virginia Commonwealth University, where he played on the baseball team as a shortstop and relief pitcher.[4] In 1997 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves where he was named a league all-star.[5][6] He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2nd round in the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft.[4]</p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>Inge began his professional career with the Jamestown Jammers, of the Single–A New York–Penn League. In 51 games, Inge batted .230.[7] His 8 homers, 10 doubles, and 29 RBI were all team–high totals.[4] Previously a shortstop, Inge became a catcher.[4]

        Inge was promoted to the West Michigan Whitecaps for the 1999 season, making 100 appearances. In June, Inge put together a hitting streak that lasted for 12 games.[4] For the season, he batted .244, with 9 homers and 46 runs batted in.[7] He also stole 15 bases, the highest single–season total for his entire baseball career.[7]
        
        Inge split the 2000 season between the Double–A Jacksonville Suns and the Triple–A Toledo Mud Hens. In 78 games with Jacksonville, he hit 6 homers, drove in 53 runs, and compiled a .258 batting average.[7] Inge saw action in 55 games with the Mud Hens, tallying 5 homers and 20 RBI, but only hitting for a .221 average.[7]
        
        Inge began 2001 in the majors, debuting as Detroit's starting catcher on opening day and throwing out a pair of Minnesota Twins baserunners in the game.[4] On April 6, he got his first MLB base hit, a double against Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Parque.[4] On June 24, Inge sustained a dislocated left shoulder. He was put on the disabled list the next day and was out of action for a month before he was sent to the Gulf Coast League Tigers for a brief rehab stint.[4] After three games with the GCL Tigers and four games with West Michigan, Inge joined Toledo on August 2 and he remained there until he was recalled by Detroit on September 1.[4] In 27 games with Toledo, Inge batted .289, with 2 homers, 11 doubles, and 15 runs batted in.[7] Inge appeared in 79 games with the Tigers, batting .180 and posting 11 doubles and 15 RBI.[7]
        
        Initially signed as a catcher, Inge struggled offensively in his first three seasons. After the Tigers signed free-agent Iván Rodríguez in 2004, Inge played in the outfield, catcher and at third base, batting .287 with 13 home runs that season.
        
        He started 159 games at third base in 2005, and led all AL third basemen in errors (23), assists (378) and double plays (42).[8] In 2006, Inge exceeded his 2005 totals with 398 assists. That number broke the Detroit Tigers single season record for assists by a third baseman (previously 389 by Aurelio Rodríguez in 1974) and was only 14 short of the all time MLB record for assists by a third baseman (set by Graig Nettles in 1971). Only five third basemen (including Graig Nettles, Brooks Robinson, and Mike Schmidt) have collected more assists in a season than Inge.
        
        In 2006, Inge showed power during the first half, with his 17 home runs tying for the team lead. His slugging percentage was .463 and he placed third on the Tigers with 47 RBIs.[9] After the All-Star Break, he raised his season average from .221 to .253 and finished with a career-high 27 home runs.[10] On October 27, 2006, Inge struck out versus St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright for the final out of the 2006 World Series.
        
        Inge became expendable at third base after the Tigers acquired Miguel Cabrera in a blockbuster trade with the Florida Marlins.[11] Inge asked management to trade him to a team where he would have a chance to be an everyday player. However, a deal was never made, and the team stated that he would be used as a utility player for the 2008 season.[12] Inge reported to spring training early with the pitchers and catchers. He was named the opening day center fielder after Curtis Granderson was placed on the disabled list.</p>

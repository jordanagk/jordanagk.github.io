<h1>Helvetica / Medium</h1>
<p>Helvetica was designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann and released in 1957 by
the Haas Type Foundry in Münchenstein, Switzerland (Helvetica). Helvetica was a favorite
of Massimo Vingelli, one of the founders of Unimark International that redesigned the
entire New York City wayfinding system in the 1960s and 70s (How). This popularity and
Helvetica’s accent to the forefront of design history is the reason I chose this font.</p>

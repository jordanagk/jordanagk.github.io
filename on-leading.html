                Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the mentorship of two hospital managers early in Don's
                career. Those influences helped Don identify key characteristics in what it takes to be an authentic

            <h3>Larry Guengerich</h3>



            <p>on Leading episode 13 features Larry Guengerich, who talks about his first real job at 15-years-old where
                he
                washed dishes at a local restaurant and learned that he did not want to do that kind of work long-term.
            </p>



            <p>He didn’t grow up near any of his grandparents, until his teenaged years when his maternal grandmother
                moved
                into
                his community – one of her children provided a trailer for her on their property. It was the first time
                he
                had
                experienced anyone aging somewhere other than their own home. Much later, Larry discovered the idea of
                how
                to be
                part of the lives and the stories of families as they go through these times of change.</p>

          <h2>Adobe Caslon Pro / Semibold</h2>
          <p>This typeface was originally created in 1722 by William Caslon. The typeface is <a href="https://issuu.com/debanjanasaha/docs/caslon_booklet">cited</a> as the first of English origin and is known as the most used font of the British empire. It was used to print a number of historical documents including the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Caslon was originally used in the printing press, but it's designs were digitized by Adobe in 1990. Today it remains one of the most widely used typefaces and has inspired the saying <a href="https://www.caseyprinting.com/blog/2013/typography/caslon-when-in-doubt-use-caslon">"When in doubt, use Caslon."</a></p>
